# SGDM-Tangram
Official implementation of **SGDM-Tangram** by *Yongxiang Lian* and *Yueyang Cang*.

---

## Overview
**SGDM-Tangram** is a cognitive image reconstruction research project.
This repository provides a minimal pipeline and core implementation for review purposes.
Complete implementation details (params, configs, preprocessing, visualization) will be available upon the official publication of the paper.

## Requirements
Run setup.sh to quickly create a conda environment that contains the packages necessary to run our scripts; activate the environment with conda activate tangram.

## Datasets
Annotations, stimulus, EEG(raw and preprocessed) of EEG-Kilogram: https://osf.io/7qm35/
